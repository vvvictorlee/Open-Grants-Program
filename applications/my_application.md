### Overview

When it comes to the rise of crypto collectables, it’s no surprise that many secondary markets have arisen for the exchange of these unique assets.

For those unfamiliar with non-fungible tokens (better known as NFTs), they are tokens which are unique from one another due to special characteristics or identifiers which distinguish them from others in a similar set.

Specifically within DeFi, we’ve seen NFTs play a role in the tokenization of assets and contracts alike, all of which play a larger role in the notion of composability – or different products interacting with one another towards a larger ecosystem.

In this overview, we’ll dive into OpenPolkadot – an industry-leading decentralized exchange (DEX) for NFTs built on Ethereum.

OpenPolkadot is an open-sourced crypto collectible marketplace which allows users to trade popular tokens built on interoperable standards like ERC721.

Prior to OpenPolkadot, there was no easy way to trade crypto collectables other than brokering over-the-counter (OTC) deals – a situation which invokes a large amount of trust and counterparty risk.

With OpenPolkadot, users can bid directly for items owned by other users, with assets being exchanged instantaneously in the event the seller accepts a bid or a buyer accepts an offer.

While there are a number of other crypto collectible marketplaces on the market, OpenPolkadot currently leads as the defacto choice for swapping NFTs.


Perhaps one of the more novel aspects is the “Rankings” feed which allows users to see which platforms and collectables are most in-demand at any given time.

Background
OpenPolkadot was founded in November of 2017 and is lead by Devin Finzer and Alex Atallah, both of which bring experience to a strong team with backgrounds from Stanford, UC Berkeley, Palantir, Google, Facebook, and Pinterest.

OpenPolkadot has raised a little over $4M in funding, most recently with a $2.1M round lead by Animoca Brands, gumi Cryptos, Stanford StartX, and David Pazdan from MetaMask. Previous rounds were supported by YCombinator, Founders Fund, Coinbase Ventures, 1Confirmation, Blockstack, and Blockchain Capital.

How Does it Work?

To get started with OpenPolkadot, simply connect a web3 wallet like MetaMask and over to the “Browse” tab.

The application automatically scans your wallet for any collectables you may have, along with the assets needed (like Ether) to purchase items off the marketplace.

When interacting with listed items, users will have the option to either enter an offer – assuming no price has been set by the seller – or accept the listed price similar to eBay’s “Buy it Now” feature.

When placing an offer, be sure to take note of what asset the offer is being placed in (ETH, DAI, etc.) as it can vary from item to item.

Once an offer has been placed, users will receive an email if their purchase is successful.

On the selling side of things, simply click Account in the top right then “My Items” and choose the item you wish to sell.

Here you will have the ability to select the price and duration of the sale along with the type of offering it is.


Listing is free, and upon the successful sale of items, OpenPolkadot will take a 2.5% fee on the final sale price.

Time-tested, audited smart contracts
OpenPolkadot is powered by the Wyvern Protocol, a set of robust Ethereum smart contracts specifically designed for buying and selling unique digital assets. The smart contracts are security audited and have been used in production with high-volume games. You won't need to deploy any additional smart contracts (other than your ERC721 or ERC155 contract) in order for your items to be instantly tradeable with our SDK.

Full customizability
You can tailor your marketplace exactly how you want it. Whether you're building with our instant OpenPolkadot Storefront solution, on your own domain with our white-labeled integration, or with a DIY approach using the OpenPolkadot SDK, you'll be able to get the exact look and feel you want for your marketplace experience.

Exposure on the largest decentralized marketplace
Thousands of users are already browsing OpenPolkadot to discover the best-priced items. When you build your own OpenPolkadot marketplace, your items will be instantly cross-listed onto the general OpenPolkadot marketplace for discovery.

With over 25,000 ETH in volume on our exchange, we have built up a liquidity pool for blockchain-based items. By using OpenPolkadot, you plug directly into this liquidity pool and truly allow the market for your items to thrive.


Earn revenue from secondary sales
Every time a user sells an item, they pay a fee — a percentage of the price it was sold. When you host a marketplace on OpenPolkadot, you get a piece of this fee. With increased volume and increased exposure, this makes using OpenPolkadot substantially preferable to building an isolated marketplace.

You can take a very small cut to encourage more trading, or a larger cut to try to maximize revenue.
The process is simple — simply specify the percentage fee you wish to take on secondary sales and an address to which the funds will be paid. To learn more about setting your fees, check out our docs.

Host your initial item sale on OpenPolkadot
Many of our partners also host their initial item sales on OpenPolkadot. This can be done entirely on the OpenPolkadot platform, and is detailed in the OpenPolkadot Crowd Sale Tutorial.


OpenSea SDK
Build your own marketplace on OpenSea, using our SDK


Want to build your own integration on top of OpenSea? Check out our SDK for the underlying toolset that allows you to power your in-game marketplace with our platform.

With the SDK, developers can build your own marketplace from scratch and integrate it more deeply in your game. Perhaps you're building a custom backend for your game and want to create trades server-side, or perhaps you need people to be able to create auctions in a deep area of gameplay. The sky is really the limit with the SDK.

As an example, you can check out the Footbattle marketplace, which is built entirely using OpenSea's SDK.


Our SDK documentation can be found here.

OpenSea Basic Integration
Integrate an existing mainnet ERC721 project into OpenSea

SUGGEST EDITS
This page is designed for developers who have already written their ERC721 contract and wish to integrate it with OpenSea. However, if you're starting fresh, we recommend following the official OpenSea Developer Tutorial.

Viewing your existing items on OpenSea
Good news! If you've deployed your ERC721 contract on the Ethereum mainnet, your items are already tradeable on OpenSea. Just go to our listing flow to view your storefront.

Metadata Standards
How to add rich metadata to your ERC721 or ERC1155 NFTs


Providing asset metadata allows applications like OpenSea to pull in rich data for digital assets and easily display them in-app. Digital assets on a given smart contract are typically represented solely by a unique identifier (e.g., the token_id in ERC721), so metadata allows these assets to have additional properies, such as a name, description, and image.

Implementing token URI
For OpenSea to pull in off-chain metadata for ERC721 and ERC1155 assets, your contract will need to return a URI where we can find the metadata. To find this URI, we use the tokenURI method in ERC721 and the uri method in ERC1155. First, let's look closely at the tokenURI method in the Creature contract.

Text

  /**
   * @dev Returns an URI for a given token ID
   */
  function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (string) {
    return Strings.strConcat(
        baseTokenURI(),
        Strings.uint2str(_tokenId)
    );
  }
  /**
   * @dev Returns an URI for a given token ID
   */
  function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (string) {
    return Strings.strConcat(
        baseTokenURI(),
        Strings.uint2str(_tokenId)
    );
  }
The tokenURI function in your ERC721 or the uri function in your ERC1155 contract should return an HTTP or IPFS URL, such as https://opensea-creatures-api.herokuapp.com/api/creature/3. When queried, this URL should in turn return a JSON blob of data with the metadata for your token. You can see an example of a simple Python server for serving metadata in the OpenSea creatures repo here.

If you use IPFS to host your metadata, your URL should be in the format ipfs://ipfs/<hash>. For example, ipfs://ipfs/QmTy8w65yBXgyfG2ZBg5TrfB2hPjrDQH3RCQFJGkARStJb.




Metadata structure
OpenSea supports metadata that is structured according to the official ERC721 metadata standard or the Enjin Metadata suggestions.

Additionally, we support several other properties that allow for multimedia attachments -- including audio, video, and 3D models -- plus interactive traits for your items, giving you all the sorting and filtering capabilities on the OpenSea marketplace.

Here's an example of metadata for one of the OpenSea creatures:

{
  "description": "Friendly OpenSea Creature that enjoys long swims in the ocean.", 
  "external_url": "https://openseacreatures.io/3", 
  "image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/opensea-prod.appspot.com/puffs/3.png", 
  "name": "Dave Starbelly",
  "attributes": [ ... ], 
}
Here's how each of these properties work:

image

This is the URL to the image of the item. Can be just about any type of image (including SVGs, which will be cached into PNGs by OpenSea, and even MP4s), and can be IPFS URLs or paths. We recommend using a 350 x 350 image.

image_data

Raw SVG image data, if you want to generate images on the fly (not recommended). Only use this if you're not including the image parameter.

external_url

This is the URL that will appear below the asset's image on OpenSea and will allow users to leave OpenSea and view the item on your site.

description

A human readable description of the item. Markdown is supported.

name

Name of the item.

attributes

These are the attributes for the item, which will show up on the OpenSea page for the item. (see below)

background_color

Background color of the item on OpenSea. Must be a six-character hexadecimal without a pre-pended #.

animation_url

A URL to a multi-media attachment for the item. The file extensions GLTF, GLB, WEBM, MP4, M4V, OGV, and OGG are supported, along with the audio-only extensions MP3, WAV, and OGA.

youtube_url

A URL to a YouTube video.

Attributes
To give your items a little more pizazz, we also allow you to add custom "attributes" to your metadata that will show up underneath each of your assets. For example, here are the attributes for one of the OpenSea creatures.


To generate those attributes, the following array of attributes was included in the metadata:

...
{
"attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Base", 
      "value": "Starfish"
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Eyes", 
      "value": "Big"
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Mouth", 
      "value": "Surprised"
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Level", 
      "value": 5
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Stamina", 
      "value": 1.4
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Personality", 
      "value": "Sad"
    }, 
    {
      "display_type": "boost_number", 
      "trait_type": "Aqua Power", 
      "value": 40
    }, 
    {
      "display_type": "boost_percentage", 
      "trait_type": "Stamina Increase", 
      "value": 10
    }, 
    {
      "display_type": "number", 
      "trait_type": "Generation", 
      "value": 2
    }
  ]
}
Here trait_type is the name of the trait, value is the value of the trait, and display_type is a field indicating how you would like it to be displayed. For string traits, you don't have to worry about display_type.

Numeric Traits
For numeric traits, OpenSea currently supports three different options, number (lower right in the image below), boost_percentage (lower left in the image above), and boost_number (similar to boost_percentage but doesn't show a percent sign). If you pass in a value that's a number and you don't set a display_type, the trait will appear in the Rankings section (top right in the image above).

Adding an optional max_value sets a ceiling for a numerical trait's possible values. It defaults to the maximum that OpenSea has seen so far on the assets on your contract. If you set a max_value, make sure not to pass in a higher value.

Date Traits
OpenSea also supports a date display_type. Traits of this type will appear in the right column near "Rankings" and "Stats." Pass in a unix timestamp as the value.

    {
      "display_type": "date", 
      "trait_type": "birthday", 
      "value": 1546360800
    }



If you don't want to have a trait_type for a particular trait, you can include just a value in the trait and it will be set as a generic property. For example,

  {
    "value": "Happy"
  }


We also support the Enjin Metadata style:

{
    "properties": {
        "base": "starfish",
        "rich_property": {
            "name": "eyes",
            "value": "big",
            "display_value": "Big",
        }
                ...
    }
}
While we advise against storing metadata on chain, if you decide that it's important for your use case, contact us at support@opensea.io and we'll get back to you with questions and next steps.

Attribute guidelines
A couple important notes when coming up with your attributes! You should include string attributes as strings (remember the quotes), and numeric properties as either floats or integers so that OpenSea can display them appropriately. String properties should be human-readable strings.

Deploying your metadata API
You're welcome to deploy your metadata API however you see fit: you can host it on IPFS, cloud storage, or your own servers. To get you started, we've created a sample API server in both Python and NodeJS:

Python example API server
NodeJS example API server
We'll create a tutorial on building and deploying your metadata server to Heroku soon! In the meantime, check out Heroku's resource on the subject.

Storing on IPFS
If you plan to store on IPFS, we recommend Pinata for easily storing data in IPFS.



Contract-level metadata
Customizing the metadata for your smart contract

SUGGEST EDITS
You can add a contractURI method to your ERC721 or ERC1155 contract that returns a URL for the storefront-level metadata for your contract.

Text

contract MyCollectible is ERC721 {
    function contractURI() public view returns (string memory) {
        return "https://metadata-url.com/my-metadata";
    }
}
contract MyCollectible is ERC721 {
    function contractURI() public view returns (string memory) {
        return "https://metadata-url.com/my-metadata";
    }
}
This URL should return data of the following format:

JSON

{
  "name": "OpenSea Creatures",
  "description": "OpenSea Creatures are adorable aquatic beings primarily for demonstrating what can be done using the OpenSea platform. Adopt one today to try out all the OpenSea buying, selling, and bidding feature set.",
  "image": "https://openseacreatures.io/image.png",
  "external_link": "https://openseacreatures.io"
}

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract - the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  Workload of an employed person ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) 
* **Total Costs:** Amount of Payment in BTC for the whole project. The total amount of funding needs to be below $30k at the time of submission.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules 
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** 0.75 BTC

### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features
...

### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on [Medium](https://medium.com/)). It should explain your work done as part of the grant. 

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant, although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.
